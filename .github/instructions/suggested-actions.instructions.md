# Suggested Actions

> Every substantive agent response should suggest 1–3 contextually relevant follow-up actions from the workspace's registered skill and agent inventory.

## Format

After the **Next Step** section in every response, include:

```markdown
## Suggested Actions

- `/skill-name` → @Agent — One-line description
- `/skill-name` → @Agent — One-line description
```

## Selection Rules

- Suggest 1–3 actions per response (not more)
- Choose based on what was just accomplished and what logically follows
- Prefer the most likely next step first
- Include at least one action from a different agent when applicable (encourage handoff)
- Skip this section only for trivial, single-exchange responses
