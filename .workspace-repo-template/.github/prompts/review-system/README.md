# Portable Review System

> Review prompts designed for use outside GitHub Copilot (external AI, copy-paste).

This directory contains portable versions of review prompts that work with any AI system:

- [review-pr.md](review-pr.md) — PR review prompt
- [review-commit.md](review-commit.md) — Commit verification prompt

## Usage

1. Copy the prompt content
2. Paste into your AI interface
3. Add the PR diff or commit information
4. Get structured review output

## Why Portable?

VS Code prompt files (`*.prompt.md`) only work in VS Code Copilot. These prompts:

- Work with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Don't require special tooling
- Follow the same review standards
- Produce compatible output format
