# Observations

> "I noticed X" — discoveries, incidents, friction points.

Date-prefixed files documenting things observed that may spawn proposals.

## Format

```
YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md
```

## Examples

- `2026-01-31-json-formatting.md` — Copilot misbehavior incident
- `2026-02-01-terminal-interference.md` — Multi-agent terminal issues

## Flow

```
Observation → (optionally spawns) → Proposal
```

## When to Create an Observation

- You discover unexpected behavior or patterns
- Something creates friction in your workflow
- An incident occurs that might inform future decisions
- You notice a recurring issue worth documenting

## Structure

No strict format required, but typically includes:

- **What happened:** Description of the observation
- **Context:** When/where it occurred
- **Impact:** How it affected work
- **Follow-up:** Whether it spawned a proposal or other action

Observations are kept tracked in git as they provide valuable historical context.
